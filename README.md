currently, this just displays a test image and dumps
some text to a computer connected via the 64drive's USB port.
the image is [a test card by Väinö Helminen](http://vah.dy.fi/testcard/)

i'm also borrowing some code from [krom's repo.](https://github.com/PeterLemon/N64/)

you will need to compile
[bass (the assembler)](https://github.com/ARM9/bass) (ARM9's fork)
and [z64crc](https://github.com/notwa/mm/blob/master/z64crc.c)
(to be included in this repo later).
